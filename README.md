## Hi there 👋


I am a Junior at Littleton High School in the class of 2027. I play baseball, basketball, and ultimate frisbee. I am in the student council as the Junior Class Vice President. I am also an Assistant Senior Patrol Leader and a Life Scout in Scouting Troop 114.

I am a new programmer with knowledge about Python and Raspberry Pi's.
